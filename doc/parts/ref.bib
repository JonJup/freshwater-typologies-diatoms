  abstract  = {Typology of waters is defined as a group of water bodies having common natural ecological conditions in terms of geo-morphological, hydrological, physico-chemical, and biological characteristics. The type descriptors are permanent characteristics that do not respond to human activities and represent the fixed abiotic conditions that explain natural variability. For the need of large-scale analysis of ecological status, multiple pressures on rivers and lakes, linkages of water body types to habitat types and for comparison of type-specific limit values for nutrients and other quality elements across countries in Europe, a broad river and lake typology was developed. Descriptors categories are dominant geology, region, river catchment, river altitude, river flow, lake size and mean lake depth. The ranges of descriptors largely follow the system A of Water Framework Directive (WFD) (EC, 2000) and are described in Lyche Solheim et al. (2019).\\
 \\
Various European data sources were used for spatial allocation of rivers and lakes broad types. The starting point was the European Catchments and Rivers Network System (Ecrins) (EEA, 2012), which is organised into sets of spatial thematic layers: lake polygons, river segments (drains), nodes representing intersection of river and catchments and almost 180,000 {\textquotedblleft}Functional Elementary Catchments (FECs){\textquotedblright}. Catchments include {\textquotedblleft}main drains{\textquotedblright} (connecting together the FECs) and {\textquotedblleft}secondary drains{\textquotedblright} (internal within a FEC). We assigned one broad type to all segments belonging to {\textquotedblleft}main drain{\textquotedblright} of each FEC and named them {\textquotedblleft}river segment".\\
\\
The catchment size of river segments in each FEC is defined as the sum of the upstream drainage area and FEC surface area. The upstream drainage area has been derived using data in {\textquotedblleft}Code Arbo{\textquotedblright} in Ecrins database (Globevnik et al., 2017). The altitude of the lower end points of river segments in each FEC is available in Ecrins river database. Lake surface area is obtained from Ecrins lake area attribute {\textquotedblleft}Area{\textquotedblright}. Data on mean lake depth were obtained from Waterbase {\textendash} Water Quality database (EEA, 2016) or estimated from terrain data. The basic map of five geological (geochemical) categories was produced from two thematic maps: bedrock map {\textquotedblleft}International Hydrogeological Map of Europe (IHME 1500$\_$v11){\textquotedblright} (Dutcher et al, 2015) and the soil map of the European Union {\textquotedblleft}SGDBE4{\textquotedblright} (JRC, 2016). The dominant geology for lakes was derived from this map with the overlay procedure. For each FEC we then defined dominant catchment geology (geochemistry) and assigned this geology type to all river segments forming the FEC{\textquotesingle}s main drain. Spatial extent of the Mediterranean region is obtained from spatial layer {\textquotesingle}Biogeographical regions of Europe{\guillemotright} (EEA, 2019). More details on methodology are in Lyche Solheim et al. (2019).},

  abstract        = {The aim of this study was to test the effect of the Water Framework Directive typology descriptors on a macroinvertebrate-based stream typology, the use of reference sites in comparison to the use of degraded sites, and both degraded and reference sites. The EU research projects AQEM and STAR provided 1660 samples of 48 stream types sampled all over the major geographical gradients in Europe. The samples included gradients from reference conditions to samples with bad ecological quality. These stream types fit the WFD typological demands. The macroinvertebrate data were analysed by using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). The observed macroinvertebrate distribution was tested against the WFD river typology by a graphical interpretation of the ordination diagrams. The major macroinvertebrate distribution patterns in European streams were based on climate (temperature), slope (current velocity), and stream size. The WFD descriptors 'System A' for stream types are too rigid and should be replaced by temperature, current, and size. The differences in average numbers of taxa between the 1660 sites distributed over Europe were either caused by differences between local environmental factors or by sampling effort, not by temperature, elevation, stream order or latitudinal position. The distribution patterns using all samples, only reference samples, and only degraded samples showed that human stress diminished the natural differences between stream communities and typologies should therefore be based on reference conditions. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

  abstract        = {European countries have defined N1000 national river types and N400 national lake types to implement the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). In addition, common river and lake types have been defined within regions of Europe for intercalibrating the national classification systems for ecological status of water bodies. However, only a low proportion of national types correspond to these common intercalibration types. This causes uncer- tainty concerningwhether the classification ofecological status is consistent across countries. Therefore, through an extensive dialogue with and data provision from all EU countries, we have developed a generic typology for European rivers and lakes. This new broad typology reflects the natural variability in the most commonly used environmental type descriptors: altitude, size and geology, as well as mean depth for lakes. These broad types capture 60â€“70{\%} ofall national WFD types including almost 80{\%} ofall European river and lake water bodies in al- most all EU countries and can also be linked to all the common intercalibration types. The typology provides a new framework for large-scale assessments across country borders, as demonstratedwith an assessment ofeco- logical status and pressures based on European data from the 2nd set of river basin management plans. The ty- pology can also be used for a variety of other large-scale assessments, such as reviewing and linking the water body types to habitat types under the Habitats Directive and the European Nature Information System (EUNIS), as well as comparing type-specific limit values for nutrients and other supporting quality elements across countries. Thus, the broad typology can build the basis for all scientific outputs ofmanagerial relevance related to water body types.},

  abstract        = {Projected climate and environmental change are expected to increase the pressure on global freshwater resources. To prepare for and cope with the related risks, stakeholders need to devise plans for sustainable management of river systems, which in turn requires the identification of management appropriate operational units, such as groups of rivers that share similar environmental and biological characteristics. Ideally, these units are of a manageable size, and are biotically or abiotically distinguishable across a variety of river types. Here, we aim to address this need by presenting a new global river classification framework (GloRiC) to establish a common vocabulary and standardized approach to the development of globally comprehensive and integrated river classifications that can be tailored to different goals and requirements. We define the GloRiC conceptual framework based on five categories of variables: (1) hydrology; (2) physiography and climate; (3) fluvial geomorphology; (4) water chemistry; and (5) aquatic biology. We then apply the framework using hydro-environmental attributes provided by a seamless high-resolution river reach database to create initial instances of three sub-classifications (hydrologic, physio-climatic, and geomorphic) which we ultimately combine into 127 river reach types at the global scale. These supervised classifications utilize a mix of statistical analyses and expert interpretation to identify the classifier variables, the number of classes, and their thresholds. In addition, we also present an unsupervised, multivariable k-means statistical clustering of all river reaches into 30 groups. These first-of-their-kind global river reach classifications at high spatial resolution provide baseline information for a total of 35.9 million kilometers of rivers that have been assessed in this study, and are expected to be particularly useful in remote or data-poor river basins. The GloRiC framework and associated data are primarily designed for broad and rapid applicability in assessments that require stratified analyses of river ecosystem conditions at global and regional scales; smaller-scale applications could follow the same conceptual framework yet use more detailed data sources.},

  abstract        = {Cluster analysis plays vital role in pattern recognition in several fields of science. Silhouette width is a widely used index for assessing the fit of individual objects in the classification, as well as the quality of clusters and the entire classification. Silhouette combines two clustering criteria, compactness and separation, which imply that spherical cluster shapes are preferred over othersâ€”a property that can be seen as a disadvantage in the presence of complex, nonspherical clusters, which is common in real situations. We suggest a generalization of the silhouette width using the generalized mean. By changing the p parameter of the generalized mean between âˆ’âˆž and +âˆž, several specific summary statistics, including the minimum, maximum, the arithmetic, harmonic, and geometric means, can be reproduced. Implementing the generalized mean in the calculation of silhouette width allows for changing the sensitivity of the index to compactness versus connectedness. With higher sensitivity to connectedness, the preference of silhouette width toward spherical clusters should reduce. We test the performance of the generalized silhouette width on artificial data sets and on the Iris data set. We examine how classifications with different numbers of clusters prepared by different algorithms are evaluated, if p is set to different values. When p was negative, well-separated clusters achieved high silhouette widths despite their elongated or circular shapes. Positive values of p increased the importance of compactness; hence, the preference toward spherical clusters became even more detectable. With low p, single linkage clustering was deemed the most efficient clustering method, while with higher parameter values the performance of group average, complete linkage, and beta flexible with beta = âˆ’0.25 seemed better. The generalized silhouette allows for adjusting the contribution of compactness and connectedness criteria, thus avoiding underestimation of clustering efficiency in the presence of clusters with high internal heterogeneity.},

The clustering algorithms used are hierarchical, crisp (neural gas, self-organizing maps, hard competitive learning, k-means, maximin-distance, CLARA) and fuzzy (c-means, fuzzy competitive learning). To compare these methods we use two performance measures, namely the correlation coefficient and the weighted Jaccard coefficient (wJC). Both performance coefficients (PCs) clearly show that the neural gas and the k-means algorithm perform significantly better than all the other methods using our setup. For the hierarchical methods the ward linkage algorithm performs best under our simulation design. In conclusion, the neural gas method seems to be the best choice for fMRI cluster analysis, given its correct classification of activated pixels (true positives (TPs)) whilst minimizing the misclassification of inactivated pixels (false positives (FPs)), and in the stability of the results achieved. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The dendrograms offer a concise picture of the overall strength of a classification as well as the compactness and isolation of individual classes. Although broadly applicable, the dendrograms were motivated by a need for easily communicated assessments of land classifications that are intended to serve as geographic frameworks for environmental research and management. The dendrograms and other similarity-based tools are applied to a single-factor classification of fish communities sampled along a 281-km section of the Willamette River in the state of Oregon (U.S.). In a second example, the tools are used to evaluate a two-factor classification of fish communities sampled in wadeable streams of Oregon's Cascade Mountains and Willamette Valley. The dendrograms help to assess the relative classification strengths of the two factors, factor interactions, and an alternative classification derived from cluster analysis},

Nevertheless, a few problems concerning the original definition of IndVal still require clarification and some modifications are also in order so as to exploit the capabilities of the method more fully. In particular, we propose novel component terms (specificity, concentration and fidelity) that may be incorporated in the calculation of IndVal and also suggest some minor, although important terminological amendments. We argue that the choice among these terms should largely depend on whether the target classification is based on abundance or presence-absence data. The expanded capabilities of the approach and the sensitivity of IndVal variants to the sharpness of classifications are illustrated by actual examples coming from a benthic macroinvertebrate survey along the Danube River and a study of dolomite grassland communities in the Buda Hills, Hungary. We found that analyses by the original IndVal plus the new variants may give a more complete picture on any classification than a particular selection among component terms of IndVal. The use of several indices simultaneously is particularly recommended when selection of indicator species is the primary objective of the study. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We used the indicator value (IndVal) method, which combines measures of habitat fidelity and specificity, to assess the indicator responses of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in Tembe Elephant Park, South Africa. The indicator responses were verified by sampling in different areas of the Park, 2 years after the responses were originally quantified. 2. We postulated that terrestrial insect indicators with different combinations of habitat specificity and fidelity might fulfil different indicator roles. Indicator species with strong habitat specificity (characteristic species) are unlikely to provide information on the direction of ecological change despite high vulnerability. Rather, detector species that span a range of ecological states are likely to be better in this role. We used IndVal for selecting such detector species that indicate the direction of ecological change. 3. Sets of species were found to be robust bioindicators, i.e. reliably characteristic across the habitat of which they were indicative. The suite of indicators was refined by discarding those with IndVals that varied significantly across years, thus improving the confidence in the final suite of species selected. By clearly responding to a change in habitat between two ecological states, detector species provided information complementary to that provided by characteristic species. 4. The IndVal method enabled both the identification and testing of indicator (characteristic and detector) species. Because of its resilience to changes in abundance, IndVal is a particularly effective tool for ecological bioindication. 5. We conclude that both characteristic and detector species are useful bioindicators of habitat quality and conversion.

  abstract        = {Ecologists often face the task of studying the association between single species and one or several groups of sites representing habitat types, community types, or other categories. Besides characterizing the ecological preference of the species, the strength of the association usually presents a lot of interest for conservation biology, landscape mapping and management, and natural reserve design, among other applications. The indices most frequently employed to assess these relationships are the phi coefficient of association and the indicator value index (IndVal). We compare these two approaches by putting them into a broader framework of related measures, which includes several new indices. We present permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of species-site group associations and bootstrap methods for obtaining confidence intervals. Correlation measures, such as the phi coefficient, are more context-dependent than indicator values but allow focusing on the preference of the species. In contrast, the two components of an indicator value index directly assess the value of the species as a bioindicator because they can be interpreted as its positive predictive value and sensitivity. Ecologists should select the most appropriate index of association strength according to their objective and then compute confidence intervals to determine the precision of the estimate.},

  abstract        = {In the EU water framework directive (WFD) a typological framework is defined for assessing the ecological quality of water bodies in the future. The aim of this study was to test the effect of data composition and taxonomic resolution on this typology. The EU research projects AQEM and STAR provided 1660 samples of 48 stream types sampled all over the major geographical gradients in Europe. These stream types fit the WFD typological demands and fit to the major European geographic regions (ecoregions). The samples included gradients from reference conditions to samples with bad ecological quality. Despite standardisation, there were large differences between the participating countries concerning the number of taxa, the number of specimens, and the taxonomic resolution. The macroinvertebrate data were analysed by using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The distribution patterns using all samples, only reference samples, and only degraded samples showed that the use of species-level (or 'best available taxonomic' level) performed better at a practical (fine) scale in comparison to family-level. The analyses further showed that even the use of a standardised protocol can not easily overcome (i) differences in site conditions that force the researcher to deviate from the protocol as well as (ii) the experiences of the researcher(s) and (iii) the available taxonomic knowledge.},
